Great job on completing Task 1! You've demonstrated a solid understanding of the foundational concepts in web development. Your implementation shows:

Good grasp of HTML structure – Proper use of semantic tags and layout elements.

Basic CSS styling skills – Applied styles enhance the visual presentation, showing attention to detail.

Responsiveness/Clarity – The layout works well across screen sizes (if applicable), which is crucial in modern web development.

Code organization – The code is readable and logically structured.


For continued improvement:

Try to add comments in the code to explain sections.

Focus on enhancing interactivity using basic JavaScript (if required in the next task).

Explore using more CSS properties or external stylesheets for better code separation.


Keep up the consistent effort and curiosity to learn more!
